Currently tracking 1,000+ YouTube channels, we allow for average calculations, overtaking date estimations, video upload notifying, future subscriber estimations, and of course, the main feature being real-time embeds and messages when your favorite channels reach new milestones.<br><br>

**Some of the commands we offer:**
- `/track` Start tracking any channel of your choice, to recieve instant updates when they reach new subscriber counts and milestones.
- `/stoptrack` Stop tracking a channel, to not recieve any more updates for it.
- `/video` Start tracking a channel of your choice to recieve instant messages when they post a new video.
- `/average` See the current average of a channel, and a graph of its history over time.
- `/overtake` See when one channel will overtake another, based on current averages and predicted growth rates.

We also offer moderation commands like `/slowmode` and more to come in the future.<br><br>

But **Communitrics** doesn't just stop there! We also offer a [live-counts website](https://communitrics.com/), a [free API](https://api.communitrics.com/) (read the API docs here) and more!
